This is a game designed to emulate the feel of NEStroid, while adding improvements to the graphics, sound, and mechanics. Each Planet is essentially a complete "game", but they are all bundled together and run on the same engine.

There are 2 complete Planets, one of which is the original NEStroid world. The other has an original design with some additional areas and bosses.

A 3rd Planet is available as a demo, and it is randomized, so each playthrough is different! You can even use a built in Room Studio to design your own rooms for it!

On top of that, you can do online multiplayer (co-op or versus), item randomizer mode, and more!

Here are some of the adjustments/additions made:
+Sharper Movement
+A Map System
+Restarting with Full Health and Ammo
+Customizable Controls
+Item Percentage, Time Counter, and Mini-map
+Randomized Mode, where Item locations will be swapped randomly
+Hard Difficulty, where enemies deal 3x Damage
+Strike Mode, where there is a finite amount of Energy and Ammo in the world, but you start with all upgrades
+Automatic Saving, no passcode needed
+Keeps track of Speedrun Data for your playthroughs
+Smoother/Added Animations
+Fancy Particle Effects
+Equipment Menu, turn items on/off
+New remixed 8-bit audio
